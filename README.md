# BIT_MANIPULATION
Here we have so many concepts on bitwise operators. It will help you to  run your code faster.  
LOOK AT THE CONCEPTS AND TRY WITH NUMBERS TO GRASP THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE REGARDING BITWISE OPERATORS.
PROPERTIES OF XOR -------
 1> a^a=0  where a is any integer
 2> a^0=a  where a is any integer
